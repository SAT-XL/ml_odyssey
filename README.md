# ml_odyssey

**ml_odyssey** is a personal project aimed at learning and experimenting with Machine Learning (ML), Data Science, and Statistics. The project serves as a playground to practice various ML algorithms, explore statistical methods, and apply data science tools, including libraries such as `scikit-learn`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `tensorflow`, and others.

This repository includes implementations of different algorithms, datasets for practice, and logs for tracking progress. The structure is designed to help me work systematically and learn at my own pace while improving my understanding of these key fields in technology.
